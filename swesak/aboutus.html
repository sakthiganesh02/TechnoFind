			<h1>ABOUT US!!</h1>
			<pre>
		Competitions and Motivation brings out hidden talents from people. To make a connection between these two factors our website plays an important role. 
		Our website enables the colleges to enter the symposium details which their college  is conducting and this in turn enables the students to be updated
		with the various college symposium details.

		We have secure connections enabled by verifying the login credentials of both the students part and the college part.

	In the end of the Registration part we have a payment page in which the student has to pay a particular amount to get registered.
	We generate random transaction numbers using the Randomize option of JavaScript.

	In the end we have a successfully registered page making the students aware of their registration part.
